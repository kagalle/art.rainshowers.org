Kenneth Galle is a photographer born and raised in the rural southern tier of New York State and now, after years away, has returned. When he was young, Kenneth was introduced to photography by his father who trained at RIT, worked as a press photographer and later as a director of audio-visual communications. This came long before the digital age, when an image required film and chemistry and patience.

Kenneth's passion is capturing a feeling behind an image, pushing back distractions, and highlighting the extraordinary buried within the ordinary. Photography has become the artistic outlet for Kenneth, providing grounding and perspective away from his career in software engineering.

### Equipment
* FujiFilm X-T100 Camera body
* Miranda 24mm f2.8 MC Macro lens, Pentax A mount
* Pentax 50mm F1.7 SMC lens, Pentax A mount
* Pro Automatic 35mm f2.8 lens, M42 mount
* Asahi Takumar 85mm f1.9 SMC lens, M42 mount
* Moto G5 Plus cell phone
* Epson Perfection 4490 scanner (Windows 10)

All of my lenses, except for the Miranda, I inherited from my father. The Takumar was his favorite lens, and for good reason. The camera's crop factor makes that lens quite long to hand hold, but it is still wonderful. The Pentax SMC is my favorite. Everything about it is beautiful, except maybe the stiff aperture ring.

### Software (all on Linux)
* gphoto2
* Darktable
* GIMP
* Hugin
* ImageMagick
* KolourPaint
* nomacs
